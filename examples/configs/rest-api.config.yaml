# Example configuration for a typical REST API
# Use case: Standard CRUD operations with authentication

services:
  - name: "User Management API"
    spec: "openapi/users-api.yaml"
    workingFolder: ["Users"]
  
  - name: "Product Catalog API"
    spec: "openapi/products-api.yaml"
    workingFolder: ["Products"]

options:
  # Preserve custom request names (e.g. "Create User (with validation)")
  keepWorkingItemName: true
  
  # Use operation IDs from OpenAPI as request names when available
  preferOperationId: true
  
  # Delimiter for separating curated docs from generated docs
  descriptionDelimiter: "\n---\n"
  
  # Tag new endpoints for easy identification
  tagNew: "status:new"
  
  # Move retired endpoints to _retired folder instead of deleting
  retireMode: "move"  # move | skip | delete
  
  # Keep existing folder order (don't alphabetize)
  order: "keep"       # keep | alpha

# Common patterns this config handles:
# ✅ Authentication headers preserved in working collection
# ✅ Test scripts for validation preserved
# ✅ Custom documentation links preserved above ---
# ✅ Environment variables in URLs/headers preserved
# ✅ Custom request names preserved
